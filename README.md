# Github-Pages-Subfolder-Redirector
This is a neat little way to redirect your Github Page to the index.html within a subfolder.

Say you upload a folder by 'drag n drop' (I know, not a good practice) into a Github Pages Repository. Automatically, your index.html will be within a subfolder. This means your Github Page will boot off of a readme.md. YOU DO NOT WANT THIS!

Sooo..
